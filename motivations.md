I decided to make a career change because I was not feeling passionate about the work I was doing in the retail supply chain field. After researching what a software development job is actually like day-to-day, it felt like a career that would be fun and that I have the skills to do well in. I also wanted to move into the tech field since there is always so much opportunity, growth, and innovation happening.
